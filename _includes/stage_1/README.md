## The Chat app program -- Stage 1

This project chronicles how I built a Chat Application using a bunch of technologies including
* WebSockets / socket.io (v. 1.2.0)
* node.js
* bower
_and more.._

The app is developed in stages, starting with the most basic functionality in [Stage 1](/chat-demo/stage_1) and with
additional features added in subsequent stages.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install chat-demo`

Then run the app with `npm start` or `node chat.js`
